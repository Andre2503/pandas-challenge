## Module 4 Data Analytics Challenge: Exploring School Performance using Pandas

In this challenge, I embarked on a journey of data cleaning, wrangling, and summarizing using the powerful pandas library in Python. Additionally, I extended my analysis by leveraging Excel to visualize data frames and uncover meaningful trends for deeper insights.

### Project Overview

For this assignment, the primary goal was to analyze and understand school performance data through a combination of data manipulation, statistical calculations, and data visualization. The provided dataset encompassed information about student math and reading scores, as well as school-specific details within a government area.

### Repository Contents

This repository contains the following key components:

- `PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook serving as the central script for the data analysis. It contains a series of data frames that summarize the data, as well as various statistical calculations using pandas.

- `Analysis folder`: This houses the exported Excel spreadsheet, and the Analysis_Report.md file—a comprehensive written record of conclusions drawn from the analysis.

- `README.md`: you are reading it now! 

### Key Takeaways

Through the combined efforts of pandas and Excel, I successfully learned crucial insights from the provided dataset. This analysis serves as a foundation for informed decision-making, particularly in the realm of school budgets and performance.
